# Swift 4 Codable Demo

This is a small demo for Swift 4.0's `Codable` protocol at
[Swift Meetup @ Taipei #22](https://www.meetup.com/Swift-Taipei-User-Group/).
(And so you need Xcode 9.0+ to open this.)

## Dependency management

This demo uses [`Alamofire`](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire),
which is installed by [`Cocoapods`](https://cocoapods.org)

## Dev Server

This demo requires a dev server, you can just open this source folder with
the `Terminal.app` and type
```sh
python simple_server.py
```
to start the development server for this demo.
